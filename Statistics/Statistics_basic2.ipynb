They provide information about how much the data points deviate from the central tendency measures (mean, median, or mode) and how spread out the values are within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Range:\n",
    "Definition: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "Use: The range gives an idea of the spread of the data from the lowest to the highest value.\n",
    "Example: Consider the following dataset of test scores: [70, 75, 80, 85, 90]. The range is calculated as 90 (maximum value) - 70 (minimum value) = 20. This means the spread of the test scores in the dataset is 20 points.\n",

    "#### Variance:\n",
    "Definition: Variance is a measure of how far the data points are spread out from the mean. It quantifies the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "Use: Variance provides an overall measure of dispersion, considering all data points.\n",
    "Calculation: The variance is computed by taking the sum of the squared differences between each data point and the mean, dividing it by the total number of data points (or n-1 for sample variance due to bessels correction to remove bias).\n",
    "Example: Continuing with the test scores dataset, let's assume the mean of the scores is 80. The variance would be calculated as [(70-80)^2 + (75-80)^2 + (80-80)^2 + (85-80)^2 + (90-80)^2] / 5 = 100. The variance of 100 indicates that the test scores have considerable variability from the mean score of 80.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Deviation:\n",
    "Definition: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is used to describe the typical amount of deviation or dispersion of data points from the mean.\n",
    "Use: Standard deviation provides a measure of the spread of data in the original units of measurement, making it easier to interpret and compare to the mean.\n",
    "Calculation: The standard deviation is computed by taking the square root of the variance.\n",
    "Example: In the test scores dataset, the standard deviation would be the square root of the variance, which is √100 = 10. This indicates that the typical deviation of the test scores from the mean of 80 is 10 points."

In a symmetrical distribution, the data is evenly distributed around the mean, with the left and right sides of the distribution mirroring each other. However, in a skewed distribution, the data is concentrated more towards one tail of the distribution, resulting in a longer tail on one side and a shorter tail on the other.\n",

    "In a positively skewed distribution, the majority of the data is concentrated towards the lower values (left side) of the distribution, and the tail extends to the right. This results in a longer right tail and a shorter left tail. The mean is typically greater than the median in positively skewed data.\n",

This results in a longer left tail and a shorter right tail. The mean is typically less than the median in negatively skewed data.\n",

It is widely used because it is scale-independent, making it easier to interpret and compare across different datasets.
