    "Ans) a) An **Exception** in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of the program’s instructions.Exceptions are runtime errors, meaning they occur while the program is running.\n",
    "When an error occurs, Python stops executing the program and raises an exception.Exception handling allows to respond to the error, instead of crashing the running program. It enables you to catch and manage errors, making your code more robust and user-friendly. \n",
    "\n",
    "b) **Syntax errors** occur when the code violates the grammatical rules of the language—such as missing colons, incorrect indentation, or misspelled keywords and must be fixed before the program can run. On the other hand, exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program, such as dividing by zero or accessing a file that doesn't exist. "
