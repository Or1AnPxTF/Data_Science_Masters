    "**Multithreading** in Python allows multiple threads to run within a single process, sharing the same memory space. It is best suited for I/O-bound tasks like reading files or handling user input, where the program spends time waiting. However, due to Pythonâ€™s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time, which limits the ability to achieve true parallelism in CPU-bound operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiprocessing**, on the other hand, involves creating separate processes, each with its own memory and Python interpreter. This enables true parallel execution, making it ideal for CPU-bound tasks that require heavy computation. Although it uses more memory and has a bit more overhead than multithreading, it fully utilizes multiple CPU cores and avoids GIL-related limitations."
