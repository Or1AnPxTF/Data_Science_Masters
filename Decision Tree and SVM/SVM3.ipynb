    "\n",
    "House price prediction is a continuous regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE penalizes large errors more heavily because it squares the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In housing prices, large prediction errors (like predicting ₹50 lakh instead of ₹1 crore) are very costly — so RMSE highlights and punishes these mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE is interpretable in the same units as the target variable (price in your case), which makes it easy to understand how \"off\" the model is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other metrics \n",
    "\n",
    "* MAE (Mean Absolute Error) — more robust to outliers but doesn't punish large errors as much.\n",
