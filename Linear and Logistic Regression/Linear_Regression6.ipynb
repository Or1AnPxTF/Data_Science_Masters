    "**1.Problem Defination & Dataset Collection :** First we formulate our problem defination and collect the data.This involves determining the objective of the application, identifying the relevant data sources, and collecting and cleaning the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Dataset Cleaning,Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering :** Then we clean the data ie.remove outliers,fill null values and convert categorical to Numerical Datatypes and select only the relevent features for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Model Training and Evaluation :** This involves selecting an appropriate model, training the model on the data, and evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.The final model selected is then coverted to pickle file for further use in the web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.Web Application Development :** This involves building a web interface that allows users to input data, processing user inputs, and making predictions using the trained model.The pickled file embedded in the flask web app predicts based on the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.Cloud Deployment :** This involves setting up the infrastructure on the cloud provider, configuring the application servers, and deploying the code. For example for deploying in AWS we use elastic beanstalk and codepipeline we add .eb extensions file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.Monitor and Maintain :** Once the application is live, it's important to monitor it regularly to ensure it's performing as expected. This includes monitoring for errors, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities. Additionally, maintenance is required to ensure the application remains up-to-date with the latest security patches and features."

    "Ans)**Traditional web hosting** typically involves hosting websites on physical servers that are located in specific data centers. These servers are often owned or leased by a hosting provider, and users rent a portion of server space (e.g., shared hosting, VPS). The server resources are fixed, meaning the website’s capacity is limited by the hardware specifications of the physical server. If the server experiences high traffic or performance issues, upgrading hardware or migrating to another server may be necessary, which can lead to downtime and higher costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **cloud hosting** uses a network of virtualized servers that run on cloud infrastructure, often spread across multiple locations or data centers. Unlike traditional hosting, cloud hosting offers scalability and flexibility — users can easily scale their resources up or down based on demand. Cloud services leverage **distributed computing** to ensure high availability and redundancy, meaning if one server fails, another can take over without downtime. This makes cloud hosting more resilient, cost-effective, and adaptable to varying workloads compared to traditional hosting."

    "Designing and building a responsive user interface (UI) for a web application involves ensuring that your application adapts seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Here’s a step-by-step approach to designing a responsive UI, along with best practices to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.Mobile-First Design:**\n",
    "Start by designing for the smallest screen size first (mobile), then progressively enhance the layout for larger screens (tablets and desktops). This approach is known as mobile-first design and ensures your UI remains accessible and functional on mobile devices, where screen space is limited.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Use flexible grid layouts (e.g., CSS Grid or Flexbox) that adjust the content based on screen size, rather than fixed pixel widths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Media Queries:**\n",
    "Use CSS media queries to apply different styles based on the device’s screen size, resolution, and other features.   \n",
    "Set breakpoints (e.g., for mobile, tablet, desktop) to adjust layout elements, such as navigation menus, buttons, and images, ensuring they look well on various screen sizes.\n",
    " \n",
    "**3.Fluid Grid Layouts:**  \n",
    "Use a fluid grid system where elements are sized relative to the screen size (using percentages, em, or rem units), not fixed pixel values. This enables your layout to adjust naturally as the screen size changes.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**4.Responsive Typography:**   \n",
    "Use relative units like em, rem, or vw for font sizes to allow text to resize based on the viewport or parent container. This ensures readability across different screen sizes.   \n",
    "Implement line-height and letter-spacing adjustments to enhance readability on small screens.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**5 Flexible Media (Images & Videos):**\n",
    "Use CSS to make images and videos responsive with properties like max-width: 100% to ensure they scale properly with the parent container.     \n",
    "Consider using SVG images for icons and logos, as they scale well on all screen sizes without losing quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.Touch-Friendly UI Elements:**   \n",
    "Make sure that buttons, links, and other interactive elements are touch-friendly on mobile devices, ensuring they are large enough to be easily tapped (e.g., a minimum size of 44px by 44px).   \n",
    "Avoid hover-dependent interactions (since hover doesn’t work on touch devices), and make actions clear through visible feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7.Progressive Enhancement and Graceful Degradation:**    \n",
    "Implement progressive enhancement to ensure that your application works on less capable devices while offering enhanced functionality for more capable devices. For example, use JavaScript to provide additional interactivity on newer browsers, but ensure the core functionality remains accessible without it.   \n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, graceful degradation ensures your app still functions on older devices or browsers by providing fallbacks for unsupported features.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Consistency: Maintain a consistent design language (colors, typography, buttons, etc.) across all breakpoints to ensure a cohesive user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Usability Testing: Conduct usability testing across devices and screen sizes to ensure your UI behaves as expected. Testing real users on different devices helps identify issues with layout and usability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Accessibility: Ensure your UI is accessible by following WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), such as proper color contrast, keyboard navigability, and screen reader compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Focus on Content: Prioritize the content and ensure it is displayed in a logical, easy-to-navigate manner, regardless of the screen size."
